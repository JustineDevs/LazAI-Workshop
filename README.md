## 🎯 What is Build & Chill?

We're launching **"Build & Chill"**, a six-week workshop series designed to help you learn by building. Each week, you'll join a live Thursday session where we dive into a practical topic, followed by a weekend task that lets you put what you learned into action. 

**The goal is simple:** build consistently, learn through doing, and grow alongside the LazAI community.

## 📅 How It Works

### Weekly Structure
- **Thursday Sessions**: Live workshops covering practical topics
- **Weekend Tasks**: Hands-on projects to apply what you've learned
- **Sunday Deadline**: Submit your work before the new week begins

### Submission Process
After every session, a submission form will be shared. You'll have until Sunday night to complete your task and submit it. This structure keeps the pace clear: join the workshop, build over the weekend, and share your work before the new week begins.

> 💡 **Missed a session?** No worries! You can still catch up using the materials and guidance available in our dedicated Discord channel → [Join here](https://discord.com/invite/nAtAEQbJpe)

## 📋 Participation Requirements

To make the most of the series, you'll need to stay engaged. Participants are expected to:

- ✅ Attend at least **5 of the 6 workshops**
- ✅ Complete at least **4 tasks on time**
- ✅ Join the Discord for updates and support

These steps ensure you're part of the full experience, learning, building, and connecting with others.

## 🏆 Rewards

We've set aside **$2,000** in rewards for those who put in the work. Rewards are tiered to recognize consistency:

| Tasks Completed | Reward Tier |
|----------------|-------------|
| All 6 tasks | 🥇 Premium rewards |
| 5 tasks | 🥈 High rewards |
| 4 tasks | 🥉 Medium rewards |

### Quality Assessment
The DevRel team will review each submission for quality. It's not just about turning something in, but about showing:
- 💪 **Effort** - Genuine attempt to apply concepts
- 🧠 **Problem-solving** - Creative approaches to challenges
- 📚 **Learning application** - Clear use of workshop concepts

## 🛠️ What You'll Build

Over the course of six weeks, you'll build a set of small but meaningful projects that demonstrate your skills with LazAI tools. Each step builds on the last, so by the end, you'll have:

- 🎯 Stronger grasp of the LazAI stack
- 🚀 Confidence to take on more ambitious projects
- 🏗️ Portfolio of practical projects
- 🤝 Connections within the LazAI community

## 👥 Who Should Join?

**Build & Chill** is designed for anyone who learns best by doing:

- 🔨 **Builders** sharpening their skills
- 🧭 **Curious learners** exploring something new
- 🎯 **Anyone** who wants a clear path to start creating

New User Scenario: Navigating DataStreamNFT Platform from Scratch

1. Landing and Welcome  
User visits the DataStreamNFT homepage. They see a clean welcome screen explaining the platform’s value: Earn continuously by minting data NFTs that AI queries pay for. Clear call-to-action buttons: “Connect Wallet” and “Learn How It Works.”

2. Connect Wallet  
User clicks “Connect Wallet” and chooses Metamask. They approve connection securely. The app confirms wallet connected and displays a simple personalized welcome message using the wallet address.

3. Quick Tour / Onboarding  
A short onboarding popup guides the user through core platform features:  
- Upload and mint datasets as NFTs  
- Browse the marketplace to discover data NFTs  
- Track query earnings and data usage  
User can skip or view detailed walkthrough slides with screenshots.

4. Upload & Mint DataStreamNFT  
User selects “Mint Dataset” on the dashboard. They upload a dataset file which the platform uploads to Pinata IPFS. Metadata form requests dataset title, description, category, and query fee price. User reviews and confirms minting transaction via Metamask. The minted DataStreamNFT appears on their profile.

5. Marketplace Exploration  
New users browse the marketplace page. They can filter datasets by category, query price, and popularity. Clicking each dataset shows detailed metadata, query pricing, contributor earnings, and user ratings.

6. Query Demo (Test AI Query)  
To get hands-on, users try the demo query feature on a public DataStreamNFT. They input a test prompt, the backend runs an AI inference query encrypted by the corresponding DAT token, returns results, and simulates micropayment to the contributor.

7. View Earnings & Stats  
Users access their personal dashboard displaying query counts, accrued revenue from AI queries, minting history, and governance voting tokens. Tutorials suggest next steps for growth.

8. Secondary Actions  
- Social sharing to invite community and gain rewards  
- Connect dataset to external AI projects via SDK  
- Join Discord and community forums for collaboration

9. Support & Help  
A visible help widget on-screen assists with FAQ, live chat, and onboarding tips.

This flow gets new users from zero experience to data NFT ownership and query interaction in under 10 minutes, balancing education with action, and introducing core platform values early.

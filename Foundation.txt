Project Foundation  
Project Name: DataStreamNFT  
Short, memorable, descriptive name that reflects the core purpose. Available domain “datastreamnft.com” and social handles are free. The name signals streaming queryable data via NFT ownership.  

Problem Statement  
Current problem: Data contributors powering AI models do not get paid for usage of their data beyond initial sales or downloads.  
Affected: Researchers, content creators, businesses supplying training data for AI and LLMs face revenue loss and lack transparency.  
Consequences: Contributors lose incentive to share high-quality data. AI projects operate with limited, often poor data sources.  
Unsolved because: No on-chain query-metering or real-time micropayment solutions for data usage. Existing marketplaces do not integrate with AI query flows and lack composability with blockchain ownership models.

Solution Overview  
DataStreamNFT enables minting data assets as NFTs with query-metered licensing that triggers micropayments on usage by AI models or applications.  
Core innovation: On-chain data licensing using DAT tokens tied to NFTs that pay contributors per AI query, enforced with encrypted access control.  
Key features: Pinata IPFS hosting, Metamask for Web3 authentication, MongoDB for off-chain metadata storage, blockchain powered by Lazchain supporting seamless query billing and ownership transfer.  
Differentiation: Focus on continuous revenue from data streaming queries, deep integration with Lazchain smart contracts, developer-friendly SDK for AI projects and GameFi tokens.  
Expected impact: Align incentives, increase high-quality data supply, enable new data asset economy fueling AI evolution.

Project Details  
Technical Stack  
- Blockchain: Lazchain Network for scalable smart contracts and token ownership  
- Storage: Pinata Cloud for decentralized IPFS file hosting and secure data storage  
- Authentication & Wallet: Metamask for secure Web3 login  
- Database: MongoDB for indexing metadata and user profiles  
- Backend: Node.js with Express for API layer and blockchain interactions  
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI  
- SDK: JavaScript SDK for data NFT minting, burning, and query metering  
- Tools: Hardhat for smart contract development, Ethers.js for wallet and blockchain calls  

Architecture  
Users upload datasets to Pinata, mint corresponding data NFTs on Lazchain. Metadata stored in MongoDB indexes NFT attributes and query usage stats. AI apps query data NFTs, triggering smart contract micropayment events on Lazchain. Payments split between contributors, platform, and curators tracked on-chain. Frontend interacts via React UI and Web3 wallet authentication; backend orchestrates calls and database syncing.  

User Stories  
- Creator uploads dataset, mints DataStreamNFT, sets query price  
- AI developer queries dataset, smart contract verifies and releases usage rights, micropayment transfers occur  
- Contributor views earned revenue dashboard, tracks query statistics  
- Secondary market trades DataStreamNFT with on-chain ownership transfer  
- Platform curators reward high-quality data NFTs through grants or boosts  

Technical Challenges  
- Real-time query metering and micropayment efficiency on Lazchain without sacrificing speed  
- Encrypted data access with off-chain storage and on-chain rights verification  
- Seamless user experience bridging Web3 wallet auth and backend-api  
- Handling secondary sales and distribution of royalties automatically  

Scalability  
- Lazchain’s efficient layer for smart contract throughput supports micropayment scaling  
- MongoDB indexes enable fast metadata search without blockchain bloat  
- Pinata distributes storage load off-chain, enabling large datasets  
- Modular SDK and API design for cross-chain extension in future releases  

Community Engagement Features  
- User feedback system on dataset quality with ratings and reports  
- Discord integration for data creator and AI developer communities  
- Gamification: Leaderboards by earnings, query volume, and contributor reputation  
- Collaborative open-source SDK with issue tracking and feature requests  
- Regular community calls and hackathons to onboard new users and gather feedback  

Design & User Experience  
UI Design / Wireframe  
- Dashboard: Mint new DataStreamNFT, view query stats, earnings  
- Marketplace: Search and filter datasets to discover NFTs  
- Wallet connect flow powered by Metamask with clear prompts  
- Query interface for AI apps to test data access  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use cases  

Deliverables  
- Wireframes for core screens: mint page, marketplace, stats dashboard  
- Prototypes for minting flow and query process  
- Design system with consistent components: buttons, cards, modals  
- Dark/light mode support  

This foundation supports a lean, scalable DataStreamNFT platform focused on the Lazchain ecosystem with key Web3 and decentralized storage integrations for sustainable AI data economies.
